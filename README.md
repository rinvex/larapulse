# Larapulse

[OBSOLETE] This project is **abandoned** and no longer maintained. The author suggests following [@LaravelLog](https://twitter.com/LaravelLog) on twitter for @laravelphp framework specific changes instead.

Larapulse was a convenient way to summarize Laravel changelog across all projects (Laravel, Lumen, Homestead, ..etc) released weekly -a week in a list-. A new report is submited automatically every monday midnight.
